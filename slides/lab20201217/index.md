# bitwise operations

## operators
 - AND( `&` )
 - OR( `|` )
 - NOT( `~` )
 - XOR( `^` )

# bitwise operations
## examples:

```c
if((1+1 == 2) && (1+1 == 3)){  //  returns false
    //  This part will NOT be executed.
}

if((1+1 == 2) || (1+1 == 3)){  //  returns true
    //  This part will be executed.
}

if(!(1+1 == 3)){ //  returns true
    //  This part will be executed.
}
```

# decision-making in C
## what "else"

 - Can only be used with `if()`.
 - Executed when the previous `if()` does not execute.

 ---

# decision-making in C
## examples:

```c
if(Letter == 'A'){
    //  Do something
}
else if(Letter == 'B'){
    //  Do something
}
else if(Letter == 'C'){
    //  Do something
}
else{
    //  Do something
}
```
---

# decision-making in C
## "switch" on
 - switch between cases
 - `break;` each cases
 - Use `default` as the last `else`

---

# decision-making in C
## examples:

```c
switch(Letter){
    case 'A':
        //  Do something
        break;
    case 'B':
        //  Do something
        break;
    case 'C':
        //  Do something
        break;
    default:
        //  Do something
        break;
}
```

---

# decision-making in C
## "switch" Tips:
 - Don't forget to break.

---

### example:

```c
 switch(Letter){
    case 'A':
        printf("The letter is A.\n");
    case 'B':
        printf("The letter is B.\n");
    case 'C':
        printf("The letter is C.\n");
    default:
        printf("None of them above.\n");
 }
```
### results:

```bash
darkknive@1091cp1:~$ ./a.out B
The letter is B.
The letter is C.
None of them above.
darkknive@1091cp1:~$
```

# repetition statements

---

# repetition statements
## Introducing "for"
 - Usage: `for(init; condition; increment){}`
 - init part will be executed before for loop start.
 - condition part will be executed before each looped. Only when return value is true will the next loop be triggered.
 - increment will be executed after each loop.

---

# repetition statements
## In conclution, this is how for loop works...
init ->
if(condition == true) -> execute { } -> increment ->
if(condition == true) -> execute { } -> increment ->
if(condition == true) -> execute { } -> increment ->
...
if(condition == false) -> leave for()

---

# repetition statements
## example:

```c
for(int a = 0; a < 5; a++){
    printf("%d\n", a);
}
```

## results:

```bash
darkknive@1091cp1:~$ ./a.out
0
1
2
3
4
darkknive@1091cp1:~$
```

---

# repetition statements
## "For" Pro Tips:

 1. Declear an int and start with 0, set condition as `index < N;` and increment as `index++`. This for loop will run N times with index = 0, 1, 2, 3......N-2, N-1.
 2. If you get a segmentation fault during runtime, it may because your for loop messed up. For example, `for(int index = N-1; index >= 0; index++)`.
 3. You may declare multiple variables in init part by using `int a = 0, b = 0, ...;`. Please note that they should be the same data type.

---

# repetition statements
## do "while"

 - Usage: `while(condition){statement(s)}`.
 - While (condition == true), do statement(s), then do the whole loop again.

## In conclution, this is how it works...

if(condition == true) -> execute { } ->
if(condition == true) -> execute { } ->
...
if(condition == false) -> leave while()

---

# repetition statements
## example:

```c
int total = 100;
while(total != 0){
    printf("%d ", total);
    total /= 2;
}
printf("\n");
```
## results
```bash
darkknive@1091cp1:~$ ./a.out
100 50 25 12 6 3 1
darkknive@1091cp1:~$
```
---

# repetition statements
## do "while"

 - Another form of while loop is `do{statement(s)}while(condition);`
 - Do statements first, then check condition.
 - Stops while (condition == false).

## In conclution, this is how it works...

execute { } -> if(condition == true) ->
execute { } -> if(condition == true) ->
...
execute { } -> if(condition == false) -> leave while()

---

# repetition statements
## example:

```c
int total = 100;
do{
    printf("%d ", total);
    total /= 2;
}
while(total != 0);
printf("\n");
```

## results

```bash
darkknive@1091cp1:~$ ./a.out
100 50 25 12 6 3 1
darkknive@1091cp1:~$
```

---

# repetition statements
## "While" Pro Tips:

 1. If your runtime is stucked, it is very possible that you have an infinite while loop. For example, `while(a > 1){printf("%d ", a);}`. The value of `a` won't be changed in the loop, so if you enters this while loop, it's gonna run FOREVER.

---

# Notes:
 - Format your code!
 - control your input smartly with scanf().
 - Every argument has its reason of existence.
 - Think as a program.
