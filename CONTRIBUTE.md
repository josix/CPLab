## Write Your Slides

All slides will be written in markdown so that it will provide a better way to keep track of changes from the resources we have created.

To achieve, it is required to using [Marp](https://marp.app/) to write your slides. You can use [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) for writing your slides in vscode. Or you can use any editor you like and use [Marp CLI](https://github.com/marp-team/marp-cli) to render it.

For more marp usage, you could follow [this gist](https://gist.github.com/yhatt/a7d33a306a87ff634df7bb96aab058b5) or [this document](https://marpit.marp.app/markdown) and also take a look at [this example](https://github.com/yhatt/marp-cli-example).
